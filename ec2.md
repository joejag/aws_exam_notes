# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

## Intro

- resizable compute capacity, scale in minutes up and down as requirements change
- Pricing models:
  - on demand: pay per hour/second, no commitment
  - reserved: capacity reservation, much cheaper (1-3 years)
  - spot: excess capacity. Dropped prices - movable. Can be terminated.
  - dedicated: physical servers, for server bound licenses
- on demand:
  - low cost, flexible without up front or long term commitments
  - short term, spiky, unpredictable workloads that cannot be interuppted
  - spikes
- reservered:
  - steady state, predictable usage
  - can make upfront payments to reduce their overall cost
  - types:
    - standard: 75% off, greater discount if you buy for longer
    - convertable: Allows you to change CPU, RAM.
