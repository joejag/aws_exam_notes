# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Object based. Max filesize of 5Tb. Universal namespace (within a partition, gov and china ones exist too). URLs has region unless in Virginia. https://joe.s3.amazonaws.com
- S3 Object has: key (name), value (bytes), versionId, metadata, sub-resources (ACL, Torrent)
- Data consistency: PUTs on new objects are immediately available. Eventual for overwrites and deletes
- S3 Guarantees: 99.99% uptime, 99.9% SLA. 11 9s durability
- S3 featuers: has tiered storage, lifecycle management (move tiers), versioning, encyption, MFA delete, secure via ACL and policies
- Storage classes (first byte latency, availability, cost are the levers):
  - S3 Standard: 99.99% uptime, 11 9s durability. Multiple AZs (can lose two AZs)
  - S3 - IA: lower storage cost, but adds retrieval costs (once a month data)
  - S3 One Zone - IA: really low cost, can sustain loss
  - S3 Intelligent Tiering: Machine learning to auto-move objects
  - S3 Glacier: super cheap, stuff you need for 7 years. Retrival: mins or hours by choice
  - S3 Glacier deep archive: cheapest, 12 hour retrieval
- Billed: Storage, requests, storage management pricing (tiers), data transfer, transfer acceleratin (Cloudfront, good for uploads), cross-region replication (HA, disaster recovery)
- Max 100 buckets per account. No limit on objects in the bucket. Don't make buckets from code, use infra as code
- Don't use it for block storage (databases, OSes). HTTP 200 on succesful requests
- Older service called "RRS" which is now IA
- Read the S3 FAQs before the exam

## S3 - creating a bucket

- Historically folks were accidenataly making their buckets public and shouting at Amazon
- Storage class can be done at an object level
- Restricting Access:
  - Bucket Policy - whole bucket
  - Object Policy - individual files
  - IAM Polices for users / groups

## S3 - pricing tiers

- Intelligent Tiering incurs a monitoring cost per 1000 objects
- Intelligent moves between Standard and IA (use this), cheaper for one zone.
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering unless you have millions of objects
- If you don't care about redundency use S3 - One zone - IA
- If you don't care about access time use Glacier

## S3 - Security and Encryption

- buckets an private by default. Can be configured to create access logs in another account's bucket
- Two types of encryption:
  - In Transit (TLS)
  - At rest (if someone steals the hard disk they could get the file)
    - server side (AWS do it):
      - S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3 - all AWS)
      - AWS Key Managed Service (SSE-KMS - AWS and you)
      - Server side with customer provided (SSE-C - you give AWS keys to use)
    - client side (you do it)

## S3 - Versioning

- Keeps deleted objects. Versioning can only be enabled - not disabled (can suspend)
- MFA delete is here - but you cannot enable it via the console
- When you upload a new version it doesn't inherit public access. Each version needs to be made public
- When you delete it leaves a 'marker' which you can then delete to restore the file
- You can delete older versions of files

## S3 - Lifecycle Management

- Allows you to automate moving objects between storage tiers
- Versioning doesn't need to be turned on to use it
- Can filter for all objects, or a folder or file extension
- Allows you to change tier after a certain amoint of days (plus for older versions)
- Can delete older version after an amount of days
- Shows a cool Timeline at the bottom

## S3 - Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock

- WORM: Write Once Read Many - fixed time or indefinetley
- Modes:
  - Governance: Need special perm to overwrite or alter the lock status
  - Compliance: Cannot be deleted by anyone
- Retention Period can be set, expiry is stored in the object metadata
- Legal Hold: Like a lock, not time bound
- Glaicer: Vault Lock: Policy cannot be changed
- You need to set object lock when first making the bucket

## S3 - Performance

- S3 prefix: folder the object lives in (so no bucket or file name included)
- first byte in S3 is 100-200ms. 3,500 writes a second and 5,500 reads per prefix
- You get linear scaling by adding prefixes
- KMS limits per region. 5k, 10k or 30k (you cannot ask for this to be raised)
- (uploads) Multipart uploads: for files over 100mb, required for over 5gb, parralllize uploads
- (downloads) S3 Byte-Range Fetches: download a range, on failure. Also allows partial file download (headers)

## S3 - S3 Select and Glacier Select

- SQL for CSV files. Saves downloading zipped CSVs
- Glacier Select: Same deal, Glacier.
- Can get columns and rows. Saves transfer costs and faster
- Not available via the Console

## S3 - Share buckets across accounts

- Three ways to share buckets across accounts
  - Bucket Policies & IAM - whole bucket - API only
  - Bucket ACLs & IAM - objects in buckets - API only
  - Cross account IAM roles - API and Console
- Cross Account - IAM > Create Role > Another AWS Account
- After creating a non-root account you can "Switch role" from the menu

## S3 - Cross Region Replication

- Requires versioning to work
- can change the storage class for replicated objects
- does not immediately replicate objects, only subsequent uploads
- does not take older versions of files across
- does not take "make public" across
- delete markers or versions are not replicated

## S3 - Transfer Acceleration

- For uploads, you get your own URL
- AWS has a tool to test it "s3 transfer acceleration tool"
- not useful for users near the edge location, but very uesful for large uploads from other parts of the world

# AWS DataSync

- Move large amounts of data from on-prem into AWS
- NFS/SMB file shares
- replicates hourly,daily,weeklt
- Involves installing a DataSync agent on prem
- Can also sync EFS volumes, imagine two EC2 instances

# Cloudfront

- Edge locations: separate from region/az
- Origin: Bucket, EC2, ELB, Route53
- Cache is on after first use, which a configurable TTL
- Distribution: Name given to the CDN. Collection of Edge locations
  - Web Distribtion: For websites
  - RTMP (flash shit - gone now): For Media Streaming
- Edge locations are not just read only, you can write to them (transfer acceleration stuff)
- You can clear caches (invalidate), but you are charged

## Cloudfront - Distribution

- global, not regional
- restrict bucket access (prevent S3 direct)
- restrict viewer access (signed URLs or Cookies)
- Can add a WAF
- Takes around 15-60 minutes to get setup or disabled (then deleted)
- Use Invalidations when things change
- Items in S3 need to be public to show in Cloudfront

## Cloudfront - Signed URLs and Cookies

- You want 1 file: Signed URL
- You want multiple: Signed Cookie
- Signed things have a Policy including: Expiration, IP ranges, Trusted signers (which Account makes them)
- Uses OAI to talk to the backing Bucket from CloudFront
- Signed URLS are made using the Cloudfront SDK
- Can do S3 directly too: Uses IAM user who created the URL. Use this when folks contact S3 directly
- Use cases
  - Origin is EC2: Use Cloudfront
  - Origin is a single file in S3: Use S3 Signed URL

# Snowball

- Huge physcial disks. 50-80Tb. Data goes into and out of S3.
- Why: network costs (20% of the cost), transfer times, security concerns
- Data is nuked by Amazon afterwards. A bunch of anti-tampering tech is in it
- Snowball Edge: 100Tb. Compute (Lambda) and Storage. Gives the option of supporting offline workloads in remote locations
- Snowball Edge Example: Airlines put them on planes as a mini-AWS
- Snowmobile: 100Pb per Snowmobile. It's a huge fecking truck. Used for video, image, complete data center migration
- When to use? Depends on amount and network capactiy. 100Mbps => 5Tb, 1000Mbs => 60Tb. Min 2Tb
- Demo: Use a client to upload files, you indicate the S3 bucket on the cmdline

# Storage Gateway

- on-prem to appliance to cloud-based storage (scalable & cost-effective)
- It's a VM image you intall in your data centre
- Three flavours:
  - File Gateway: NFS / SMB onto S3/Glacier
  - Volume Gateway (virtual hard disk drives): iSCSI (stored / cached volumes), async
    - Stored Volumes: All data locally and all remote
    - Cached Volumes: Frequent data cached locally and all remote
  - Gateway Virtual Tape Library: Get rid of tapes

# Athena vs Macie

- Athena: Interactive query service on S3. Serverless, pay per request, no ETL setup
- Athena use cases: query log files, biz reports, AWS cost reports, queries on click stream data
- Macie: ML to detect, classify and protect PII stored in S3. Also uses CloudTrail
- Macie: Give alerts, dashboard. Good for PCI-DSS and preventing ID theft

# S3 & IAM Summary

- IAM
  - IAM: User, Groups, Roles. Get Polices (written in JSON) applied to them
  - IAM is universasl. "root account" is the one when you first create the AWS account
  - New users have no perms (least priv). Get Access and Secret Key when created (for APIs)
  - If you lose the Access or Secret key you have to recreate them
  - Alwasy setup MFA on root account, configure password policy
- S3
  - Object based. 0-5Tb. Unlimited. Folder in the cloud.
  - Universal namespace
  - By default all buckets are private. Use Bucket Polices, ACL
  - Can be configured to create access logs
- S3 Fundamentals
  - Key (name), Value (bytes), VersionId, Metadata, Subresoruces (ACL, Torrents)
  - Read after write consistency on new Objects
  - Eventual consistency for Reads after Writes on existing Objects
  - Tiers:
    - Standard (99.99%, 2 AZs)
    - IA (2 AZs, cheap/retrivel fee)
    - One Zone - IA (1 AZ)
    - Intelligent (ML moving)
    - Glacier - minutes to hours
    - Glacier Deep Archive - 12 hours
  - Encryption:
    - In Transit: TLS
    - At Rest: Server Side (Managed Keys, Key Management Service, Customer Provided Keys) or Client
  - AWS Organisations:
    - MFA, Passwords, Root is for billing only, Use SCP for OUs or Accounts
  - S3 Sharing:
    - Bucket Policies & IAM (whole bucket) - API
    - Bucket ACLs (Objects) - API
    - Cross account IAM roles - API and Console
  - Cross Region Replication
    - Versioning is required on both buckets
    - Existing files are not replicated automatically - subsequent files are
    - Delete markers are not replicated not are version deletes
  - Lifecycle Policy
    - Autoamtes moving objects between tiers
    - Works with versions as well
  - S3 Transfer Acceleration
    - Upload over Edge network
  - Cloudfront
    - Egde Location (where it is cached on 2nd call) - not just read only
    - Origin (S3 bucket, ELB. EC2, R53, where the files come from)
    - Distribution: Name of the CDN
    - Objects are cached for TTL (1 day up to 1 year)
    - Can clear cached objects - but are charged
  - Snowball
    - Big disk to move data in and out of S3
  - Storage Gateway
    - File Gateway: flat files onto S3 over NFS
    - Volume Gateway (iSCSI):

      - Cached: Most frequent data locally AND all on S3
    - Gateway Virtual Tape Library
      - Backups using existing popular apps
  - Athena
    - Interactive query service for S3. Serverless. Usually for log data
  - Macie
    - PII scanner for S3
    - CloudTrail scan and suspeicous API calls
    - PCI-DSS, gives alerting

# S3 FAQs

## General

- Intelligent Tiering is for when you don't know your access requirements
- S3 Outposts is to allow you to keep data residency on site
- First level categorisation is folders (prefixes), second level is tags (max 10 tags per object)
  - You can grant access control in IAM by Tag. Lifecycle by Tag, Analytics by Tag, CloudWatch metrics by Tag
  - Apply to loads of objects using S3 Batch
  - Tags are replicated
- You can get a PCU (Provisioned Capacity Unit) for retrievals.
- Costs (internal): via region, none for EC2 to S3.
- For cross-account you can put on "requestor pays" so they get billed instead of you
- S3 Event Notifications on operations can go to SNS, SQS or Lambda
  - Can be used via prefixes
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Offers another domain name, so you can choose which one to use. This is called "dual stack"
  - You aren't charged if the user didn't get an increased speed
  - Use CloudFront instead if the objects are below 1Gb.
  - Used for customers. AWS Direct Connect is for your own data center

## Security

- Auth: There is also Query String auth (which can be time bound)
- Encryption: SSE-KMS exists to help with some legislation like PCI-DSS/HIPPA.
  - The SDK also has a class to perform Client side encryption
- AWS PrivateLink allos you to talk to S3 via AWS Direct Connect and keep S3 off the Internet
- Access Points: Permisions at scale (100s of Apps)
  - Gives unique hostnames to Buckets
  - Can restrict to your VPC. Then use SCP to restrict each account to VPC only access
  - Ideal for shared S3 Buckets. Saves messy Policies by creating Application rules (safer for changes)
  - "network origin control" is the item in the Policy you set to 'vpc' to prevent any Internet access
