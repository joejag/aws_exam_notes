# IAM

## Intro

- It's universal, not by region
- Use a root account just for billing, make a new user straight away
- New users have no perms. Can have Console or API key access
- You can configure MFA and password rotation policies

## Billing

- Cloudwatch > Alarms > Billing > Create (uses SNS to email)
- Shows alarm as "insuffcient" until 6 hours have passed
